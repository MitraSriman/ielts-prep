{title:"Passage 1: Urban Farming Revolution", text:`Urban farming has become increasingly popular in cities worldwide. As urban populations grow, access to fresh produce has become a challenge. Rooftop gardens, vertical farms, and community plots provide local food while reducing transportation costs and carbon emissions. Researchers argue that urban farming also strengthens community ties and improves mental health. However, critics point out limitations such as space constraints, water supply issues, and high initial costs. Cities are exploring policy incentives and grants to support urban agriculture. The integration of technology such as hydroponics and smart watering systems is making it more viable.`},
{title:"Passage 2: Sleep and Cognitive Performance", text:`Sleep plays a critical role in memory formation, emotional regulation, and physical recovery. Studies show that adults require between seven and nine hours of sleep per night. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to reduced concentration, weakened immunity, and increased risk of long-term illness. Despite this, modern lifestyles and excessive screen use disrupt natural sleep cycles. Napping, sleep hygiene practices, and mindfulness exercises are recommended to improve sleep quality. Research is ongoing to understand the impact of irregular work shifts on long-term cognitive performance.`},
{title:"Passage 3: History and Evolution of Paper", text:`Paper was invented in China over two thousand years ago and later spread to the Islamic world and Europe. The invention revolutionized record keeping, education, and art. Early paper was made from mulberry bark, hemp, and rags. Despite the rise of digital media, paper remains widely used due to its affordability, reliability, and accessibility in regions with limited technology. Innovations in papermaking over centuries improved quality and durability. Today, recycled paper and sustainable production are key focus areas for environmental conservation.`}
