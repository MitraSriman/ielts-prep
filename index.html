 title:"Passage 1: The Rise of Urban Farming",
 text:`Urban farming refers to the practice of cultivating crops and raising livestock within cities and towns. In recent years, it has gained popularity as urban populations increase and concerns about food security intensify. Rooftop gardens, vertical farms, and community allotments allow residents to grow fresh produce close to where it is consumed, significantly reducing transportation costs and carbon emissions. Supporters argue that urban farming improves mental well-being and strengthens community bonds. However, critics highlight challenges such as limited space, soil contamination, and high initial investment costs.`
},
{
 title:"Passage 2: Sleep and Human Performance",
 text:`Sleep is essential for physical health, cognitive function, and emotional well-being. Research indicates that most adults require between seven and nine hours of sleep per night to function optimally. Insufficient sleep has been linked to impaired memory, reduced concentration, weakened immune response, and a higher risk of chronic illnesses. Despite widespread awareness of its importance, modern lifestyles, shift work, and excessive screen exposure continue to disrupt natural sleep patterns.`
},
{
 title:"Passage 3: The Development of Paper",
 text:`Paper was first invented in China during the Han Dynasty and later spread through trade routes to the Middle East and Europe. Its introduction transformed education, administration, and the dissemination of knowledge. Although digital technology now dominates information storage, paper remains widely used due to its affordability, reliability, and accessibility, particularly in regions with limited access to electronic devices.`
